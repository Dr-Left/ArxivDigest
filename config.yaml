# For physics topics, use the specific subtopics, e.g. "Astrophysics"
topic: "Computer Science"
# An empty list here will include all categories in a topic
# Use the natural language names of the topics, found here: https://arxiv.org
# Including more categories will result in more calls to the large language model
categories: ["Artificial Intelligence", "Computation and Language", "Machine Learning"]

# Maximum number of papers to keep after filtering by score.
# Papers are ranked by relevancy score (descending) and top N are kept.
# If multiple papers tie at the cutoff score, all of them are included.
#
# Set to 0 for no limit (keep all scored papers)
max_papers: 10

# A natural language statement that the large language model will use to judge which papers are relevant 
#
# For example:
#     "I am interested in complexity theory papers that establish upper bounds"
#     "gas chromatography, mass spectrometry"
#     "making lots of money"
#
# This can be empty, which just return a full list of papers with no judgement or filtering,
# in whatever order arXiv responds with.
